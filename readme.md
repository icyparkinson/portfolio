  <h2>Overview</h2>
  
  Hi there! Thanks for making your way to this readme. I built this portfolio from scratch and it's forever getting updated and tweaked. I try to improve it as much as I can and whenever I think of possible improvements. I hope you enjoy your time browsing and learning more about me!
  
  <h2>Features</h2>
 
  Feel free to use the links on the top right corner of the site to quickly navigate to different sections of the page. I made this website to act as my portfolio to display my work. As I make more interesting projects, I'll include them here so please check back again later to find more! There's also a contact section so that you can reach out to me in case you have any questions or would like to connect. I'm always happy to meet and talk to someone new.
